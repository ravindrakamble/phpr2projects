	When you use our Website, we store your browsing information. Our primary goal in doing so is to 
provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and 
features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer

necessary for achieving this purpose.
In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal 
information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. 
Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the 
option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. 
We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. 
We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour 
to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an 
aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is 
on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your 
computer browser information, and your IP address.
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our

about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to
