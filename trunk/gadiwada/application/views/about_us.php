Cab booking but also bus booking gave birth to gadivada.com because of its Odia name the website within a very short span of time achieved a huge popularity in Odisha. But due to the online nature of business the Bus owners were very much reluctant to reserve 2 bus ticket in their bus. However the cab part was working smoothly but without a revenue model as travel agents were pretty reluctant to pay a portion, sparing very few.

Situations and circumstances gave us a new direction where everything could be automated. This travelder.com was build keeping in mind how to automate the entire travel management system, which created a Win-Win situation for every stakeholder.
